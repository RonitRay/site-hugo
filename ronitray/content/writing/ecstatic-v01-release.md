Today I am formally releasing v0.1 of Ecstatic, a static site generator that I wrote in Python using the Jinja template engine.

This generator was initially intended only to generate this blog, but I think I've been able to make it generic enough to be extensible.

2. [Documentation](/ecstatic-documentation)

*Please note that this is a point release and is still very much a minimal and raw project. I definitely recommend getting your hands dirty with it, but you should think twice before deploying it in a production environment where things move quickly and break fast.*
