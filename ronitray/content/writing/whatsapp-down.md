Almost exactly two months ago, [Signal went down](/signal-down).

In my post about it, I mentioned these were likely growing pains and the platform would get more stable as they learn to deal with the new scale of their user base and as donations and support come in to help them out. I also said:

>*It is worth remembering that even services that are backed by some of the largest corporations in the world like WhatsApp have been down similarly less than a year ago, and have experienced scaling issues during the pandemic as more people find themselves online than ever before. This too, I must believe, shall pass.*

Well... WhatsApp and Instagram seem to be out worldwide now. It's not something worth celebrating, and I don't mean to gloat, but...
