  <p>The year was 2017. I was fresh off reading almost a hundred books in the previous year and raring to go again. My to-read lists on Goodreads and in notebooks and excel spreadsheets were overflowing with entries, most of them likely to be enjoyable. I was taking pride in being called &ldquo;well-read&rdquo; by peers, and just about beginning to feel the same way about myself. But I wasn&rsquo;t happy.</p>
<p>In hindsight, it&rsquo;s easy to say I made a change in my life because I wasn&rsquo;t happy, but the truth is I never know if I&rsquo;m happy or not on a given day. I just <em>am</em>. But I remember clear as day that on a particular day in 2017, I got rid of every single list I had. They were deleted, cast aside, and banished to oblivion. If you asked me why that day, I&rsquo;d probably say <em>because I could.</em></p>
<p><em>Pudge, what you must understand about me is that I am a deeply unhappy person</em>, says a John Green character in Looking for Alaska. I suppose the part of me left buried in his body of work, the part I shamelessly resuscitated while watching the series adaptation of Looking for Alaska for Hulu, would likely refer to himself in a similar fashion. In many ways, it was true and perhaps still is. I&rsquo;ve enjoyed reading since I picked up the habit at 4 or 5 years old. I&rsquo;ve read hundreds of books, carried stacks of books home from the school library that the librarian would challenge me I wouldn&rsquo;t finish by the due date (I always won), and relentlessly pursued books in every shape or form I could find. But on that day in 2017, I felt like I didn&rsquo;t enjoy reading. That I wasn&rsquo;t reading for reading&rsquo;s sake, for enjoyment, for fulfillment, or for entertainment. I felt like I was reading to put numbers on a list- to be able to brag to a Facebook group that I was admin of at the time that I&rsquo;d actually outread several of them that year, that somehow my being this prolific made me smarter, superior, better than them. And I&rsquo;d probably get away with saying that I gave up this pursuit out of the goodness of my heart, realizing the poor grasp of reality that I held on so dearly to. Alas, introspection is a boon that comes in trickles to men of moderate privilege like myself, and my boon felt it was enough to let me know that I was exhausted trying to live up to this perception of myself.</p>
<p>And so, it was done. I made a vow to myself that I would read only on my own terms, and that I&rsquo;d follow a laissez-faire approach to any literary pursuits I follow and live a little vicariously, without the pressures that structures might impose. How do I feel about it 3 years later? There is some wistfulness about the whole &ldquo;so many books in the world, so little time&rdquo; shtick- certainly I&rsquo;ve read fewer and fewer books year-on-year. Of course, surrounding conditions haven&rsquo;t necessarily enabled literary voracity, but that&rsquo;s alright because I had no targets, no expectations. Just a world of literature waiting for me to reach out. I don&rsquo;t think of myself as well-read anymore, but I&rsquo;ve made peace with it. I enjoyed most of what I&rsquo;ve read and am finding my way back to establishing a healthy reading habit.</p>
<p>Probably couldn&rsquo;t have asked for more.</p>
